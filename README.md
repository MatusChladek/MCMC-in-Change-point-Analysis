# MCMC in Change point Analysis

In this small research project my goal was to identify change point and estimate the intensities of the Poisson process before and after this change point. For this task MCMC methods are used since we need to draw a samples from 5-dimensional posterior distribution. Depending on whether full conditional distributions are well known distributions such
as the Gamma or Normal or not we can perform Gibbs updates or in latter case Metropolis-Hastings sampler.
